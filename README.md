# Loot Manager
Create a blacklist of items to stop looting. Use the Loot All button and never worry about the items you don't want again.

## Installation
- Install [BepInEx Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/c/erenshor/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/)
- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/et508/Erenshor.LootManager)
- Extract files from Erenshor.LootManager.zip into Erenshor\BepInEx\plugins\ folder.

## Configuration
- Run Erenshor so the config file will be automatically created
- Open *et508.erenshor.lootmanager* in your Erenshor\BepInEx\config
- Change values to your liking.
- I recommend using a config manager like [BepInExConfigManager](https://github.com/sinai-dev/BepInExConfigManager) for easier config changes from in-game.

## Loot Manager Commands
- /addloot - Adds a new item to the blacklist. (Item names are case sensitive and must be spelled exactly how they are in-game.)
- /removeloot - Removes a item from the blacklist. (Same as addloot item names are case sensitive and must be spelled exactly how they are in-game.)
- /showloot - Shows a list off all items currently on the blacklist.
